# KGCNN
This repository stores all of the necessary codes and data for training and testing of the Knowledge-Guided Convolutional Neural Network, used for the prediction of shape parameters, drag coefficient, mass, and volume of falling snowflakes.

Final results file holds all results shown in paper. synth_pretrain and snowflake_train allow the user to train and test the KGCNN on synthetic data and real snowflake data with parameters to tweak. Synthetic and real datasets are given as used in the paper.

Synthetic aggregate projections and data obtained from Kobschall et al. (2023), available at: https://tudatalib.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/handle/tudatalib/3588

Data from Kajikawa (1981) and Locatelli and Hobbs (1974) were obtained from Dr. Andrew Heymsfield at NCAR.

Data from Theis et al. (2022) was obtained from Dr. Miklos Szakall at Johannes Gutenberg University at Mainz.
