# Final results from published KGCNN models
Each CSV file contains the original data as well as predictions by the KGCNN model. Each shape parameter is an output from the model, as well as Cdout and massout.

rhoc, rhol, and rhos are predictions of snowflake density obtained from the crosswise sphericity, lengthwise sphericity, and sphericity, respectively. Final density predictions are obtained by averaging the three.
